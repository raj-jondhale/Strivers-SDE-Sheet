// Given arrival arr[] and departure dep[] times of trains on the same day, find the minimum number of platforms needed so that no train waits. A platform cannot serve two trains at the same time; if a train arrives before another departs, an extra platform is needed.

// Note: Time intervals are in the 24-hour format (HHMM) , where the first two characters represent hour (between 00 to 23 ) and the last two characters represent minutes (this will be <= 59 and >= 0). Leading zeros for hours less than 10 are optional (e.g., 0900 is the same as 900).

// Examples:

// Input: arr[] = [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800], dep[] = [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: There are three trains during the time 9:40 to 12:00. So we need a minimum of 3 platforms.
// Input: arr[] = [900, 1235, 1100], dep[] = [1000, 1240, 1200]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: All train times are mutually exclusive. So we need only one platform.
// Input: arr[] = [1000, 935, 1100], dep[] = [1200, 1240, 1130]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: All 3 trains have to be there from 11:00 to 11:30
// Constraints:
// 1 ≤ number of trains ≤ 105
// 0000 ≤ arr[i] ≤ dep[i] ≤ 2359
