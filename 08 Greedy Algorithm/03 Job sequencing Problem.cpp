You are given two arrays: deadline[], and profit[], which represent a set of jobs, where each job is associated with a deadline, and a profit. Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete, and only one job can be scheduled at a time. You will earn the profit associated with a job only if it is completed by its deadline.

Your task is to find:

The maximum number of jobs that can be completed within their deadlines.
The total maximum profit earned by completing those jobs.
Examples :

Input: deadline[] = [4, 1, 1, 1], profit[] = [20, 10, 40, 30]
Output: [2, 60]
Explanation: Job1 and Job3 can be done with maximum profit of 60 (20+40).
Input: deadline[] = [2, 1, 2, 1, 1], profit[] = [100, 19, 27, 25, 15]
Output: [2, 127]
Explanation: Job1 and Job3 can be done with maximum profit of 127 (100+27).
Input: deadline[] = [3, 1, 2, 2], profit[] = [50, 10, 20, 30]
Output: [3, 100]
Explanation: Job1, Job3 and Job4 can be completed with a maximum profit of 100 (50 + 20 + 30).
Constraints:
1 ≤ deadline.size() = profit.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ deadline[i] ≤ deadline.size()
1 ≤ profit[i] ≤ 500
